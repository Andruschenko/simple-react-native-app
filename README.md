# A simple React Native App: Pictorio - The image viewer

We built this tiny React Native Mobile App as part of the ["Mobile development for complete beginners" workshop](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Session:Mobile_App_Entwicklung_f%C3%BCr_totale_Anf%C3%A4nger) at the 36th edition of the Chaos Communication Congress.

The slides of the talk can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SRET00zlK8-jbwDSuPjmKNOL4gCwnX2KHSRCOui2WUE/)

## How to run

Run the following commands in your **terminal**:

1. Download the code

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:Andruschenko/simple-react-native-app.git
    ```

    Alternatively run `git clone https://github.com/Andruschenko/simple-react-native-app.git` if the upper command does not work (because you haven't set up your ssh connection to GitHub yet or encounter some error).

2. Enter the directory of the downloaded code

    ```
    cd simple-react-native-app
    ```

3. Install dependencies

    ```
    yarn
    ```

4. Start the expo development server

    ```
    yarn start
    ```

## How to make changes

Open the file `App.js` in the main directory. All the important code of the app is in here.
