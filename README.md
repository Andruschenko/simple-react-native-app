# A simple React Native App: Pictorio - The image viewer

## Setup of your computer to start Expo development

See this [Setup Guide (in German)](./SETUP.md).

## How to run

Run the following commands in your **terminal**:

1. Download the code

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:Andruschenko/simple-react-native-app.git
    ```

    Alternatively run `git clone https://github.com/andrekovac/simple-react-native-app.git` if the upper command does not work (because you haven't set up your ssh connection to GitHub yet or encounter some error).

2. Enter the directory of the downloaded code

    ```
    cd simple-react-native-app
    ```

3. Install dependencies

    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the expo development server

    ```
    npm start
    ```

## How to make changes

Open the file `App.js` in the main directory. All the important code of the app is in here.
